## Description of My Approach

This project is a **User Management System** built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** for the frontend. It includes a fully functional **registration form** and a **dynamic data table** to manage users.

**Key Approaches Taken:**

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Each feature (InputField, DataTable, Header) is built as a reusable React component, making the project scalable and maintainable.
- **State Management:** Used React `useState` and `useMemo` hooks to handle form inputs, validation, sorting, and selected rows efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Forms:** The registration form includes:
  - Live validation for accurate input
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Clear input buttons
  - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- **Dynamic Data Table:** Features include:
  - Column sorting
  - Row selection (single and multiple)
  - Loading and empty states
  - Dark and light theme support
- **Theming:** Supports both light and dark modes for a professional, accessible UI.
- **Performance:** Optimized rendering using memoization and avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

The project aims to provide a **smooth and intuitive experience** for managing users while demonstrating **clean code practices** and modern frontend development patterns.
